create an API with the POST request

create a classifier model

send data through the API to the classifier to make predictions

----------------------------------------

last class:

we created an API
added data to API using post request
---------

before 

we have created multiple prediction models and provided data in various ways

Today we are going to do one more such thing where we pass data through the API
that we create and then see how well our prediction model performs

-----------------------------------------------------

steps:

1.import all the dependancies/libraries
2.get the data to train and test the model
3.split the data to train and test the model
4.scale the data to make it of equal size
5.fit the data into logistic regression model
6.make predictions
---------------------------
Today we will be providing the data through the API

--------

mnsit data,version 1, getting x and y values of it

Now we need to scale the data,to make sure the data points in X and Y are equal
so we will divide them using 255,which is the maximum pixel of the image.


--after scaling the data, fit the data into our model


now, the classifier is ready.using the classifier,if we have an image,we can predict the digit mentioned 
on the image

get_prediction()
will take the image as parameter and make prediction

take the image
convert it into a scalar quantity
make it grey,so that colors dont affect the prediction
resize it into 28 by 28 scales
use the percentile function to get the minimum pixel
use clip function to give each image a number
then get the maximum pixel and make an array of this

create a test sample of itand make predictions based on that samplefinally return the test prediction
